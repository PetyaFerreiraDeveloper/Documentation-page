                        What is Breastfeeding?
                        Breastfeeding is when you feed your baby breast milk, usually directly from your breast. It’s also called nursing. Making the decision to breastfeed is a personal matter. It's also one that's likely to draw opinions from friends and family.
                        Many medical experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, strongly recommend breastfeeding exclusively (no formula, juice, or water) for 6 months. After the introduction of other foods, it recommends continuing to breastfeed through the baby’s first year of life.
                        How often you should breastfeed your baby depends on whether your baby prefers small, frequent meals or longer feedings. This will change as your baby grows. Newborns often want to feed every 2-3 hours. By 2 months, feeding every 3-4 hours is common, and by six months, most babies feed every 4-5 hours.
                        You and your baby are unique, and the decision to breastfeed is up to you. 
                        Signs Your Baby is Hungry
                        One of the most common ways your baby will let you know they're hungry is to cry. Other signs your baby is ready to be fed include:
                    <ul>
<li>Licking their lips or sticking out their tongue</li>
<li>Rooting, which is moving their jaw, mouth, or head to look for your breast </li>
<li>Putting their hand in their mouth</li>
<li>Opening their mouth </li>
<li>Fussiness </li>
<li>Sucking on things </li>
                    </ul>

                        How baby sleep changes from 2 to 12 months
                        As they get older, babies:
                        sleep less in the daytime
                        are awake for longer between naps
                        have longer night-time sleeps and wake less at night
                        need less sleep overall.

                        2-3 months: what to expect from baby sleep
                        At this age, babies sleep on and off during the day and night. They sleep for around 16 hours in every 24 hours.
                        Babies sleep in cycles that last about 40 minutes. Each cycle is made up of active sleep and quiet sleep. Babies move around and grunt during active sleep, and sleep deeply during quiet sleep.
                        At the end of each cycle, babies wake up for a little while. They might grizzle, groan or cry. They might need help to settle for the next sleep cycle.
                        Around 2-3 months, babies start developing night and day sleep patterns. This means they tend to start sleeping more during the night.

                        Around 3 months: what to expect from baby sleep
                        Around three months, babies’ sleep changes to longer cycles of light sleep, deep sleep and dream sleep. These changes might mean less waking and resettling during sleep.
                        At this age, babies might regularly be having longer sleeps at night – for example, around 4-5 hours.
                        Babies still need around 16 hours sleep in every 24 hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
3-6 months: what to expect from baby sleep
At this age, babies need 15-16 hours of sleep every 24 hours.

Babies might start moving towards a pattern of 2-3 daytime sleeps of up to two hours each.

And night-time sleeps get longer at this age. For example, babies might be having long sleeps of six hours at night by the time they’re six months old.

But you can expect that your baby will still wake at least once each night.

                        You've gone through pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and now you're ready to go home and begin life with your baby. Once home, though, you might feel like you have no idea what you're doing!

                    <p>
                        These tips can help even the most nervous first-time parents feel confident about caring for a newborn in no time.

                        Getting Help After the Birth
                        Consider getting help during this time, which can be very hectic and overwhelming. While in the hospital, talk to the experts around you. Many hospitals have feeding specialists or lactation consultants who can help you get started nursing or bottle-feeding. Nurses also are a great resource to show you how to hold, burp, change, and care for your baby.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        For in-home help, you might want to hire a baby nurse, postpartum doula, or a responsible neighborhood teen to help you for a short time after the birth. Your doctor or the hospital can help you find information about in-home help, and might make a referral to home health agencies.
                    </p>               
                    <p>
                        Relatives and friends often want to help too. Even if you disagree on certain things, don't dismiss their experience. But if you don't feel up to having guests or you have other concerns, don't feel guilty about placing restrictions on visitors.

                    <p>
                        Infant formula, baby formula or just formula (American English) or baby milk, infant milk or first milk (British English), is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding to babies and infants under 12 months of age, usually prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) defines infant formula as "a food which purports to be or is represented for special dietary use solely as a food for infants by reason of its simulation of human milk or its suitability as a complete or partial substitute for human milk".

                        Causes of Unexplained Crying
                        Hungry Baby. The most common reason babies cry is because they are hungry. They stop crying at the onset of feeding. By the end of the feeding, they are happy.
                        Sleepy Baby. The second reason babies cry is they need sleep. They need their parent to put them in a comfortable position. It may be swaddled and on their back. Then they fuss a little and fall asleep.
                        Fed Too Much. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some babies cry because of a bloated stomach from overfeeding. Unlike gas, too much milk can cause discomfort that lasts a short time.
                        Caffeine. Caffeine is a stimulant that can cause increased crying and trouble falling asleep. Breastfeeding mothers need to limit their caffeine intake.
                        Clothing. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being too hot or too cold can make a baby cry. So can clothing that is too tight.
                        Dirty Diaper. Stool is very irritating to the skin. If not cleaned off, it can cause pain and burning.
                        Colic. Colic is the main cause of recurrent crying during the early months. All babies have some normal fussy crying every day. When this occurs over 3 hours per day, it's called colic. When they are not crying, they are happy.
                        Pain (Serious). Painful causes include an earache, mouth ulcers, or a raw diaper rash. An ulcer on tip of penis may also cause pain and crying. These babies cry a lot and are not happy when they are not crying. They need to see a doctor to make a diagnosis. Fever in this age group is serious until proven otherwise. Shaken baby syndrome is a concern.
